# Smartphone-Data-Analysis-Project

## Project Overview

This project involves data visualization and machine learning model applications on a dataset webscraped from the Flipkart website. The dataset originally had only a few columns, but  preprocessed it to add more relevant columns according to our needs.

## Contents

- **processed_final.csv:** Contains the cleaned and preprocessed data.
- **Casestudy-2.ipynb:** Includes the code for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning models.
- **Untitled.ipynb:** Provides detailed insights and findings from the analysis.


## Dataset Description

The dataset includes various attributes of smartphones listed on Flipkart. Initially, the dataset had limited columns, but additional columns were added during preprocessing to enhance the analysis.

### Original Columns

- **Title:** Title or name of the smartphone product.
- **Original Price:** Original price of the smartphone.
- **Offer Price:** Offer price of the smartphone.
- **Stars out of 5:** Average star rating out of 5 for the smartphone.
- **Ratings:** Number of ratings received for the smartphone.
- **Flipkart Assured:** Whether the product is Flipkart Assured or not.
- **Specification:** Detailed specifications of the smartphone.


### Added Columns

- **Product Name:** Name of the smartphone product.
- **Original Price:** Original price of the smartphone.
- **Offer Price:** Offer price of the smartphone.
- **Stars out of 5:** Average star rating out of 5 for the smartphone.
- **Ratings:** Number of ratings received for the smartphone.
- **Flipkart Assured:** Whether the product is Flipkart Assured or not.
- **Specification:** Detailed specifications of the smartphone.
- **Color:** Color options available for the smartphone.
- **Reviews:** Customer reviews for the smartphone.
- **Discount:** Discount percentage offered on the smartphone.
- **Brand:** Brand of the smartphone.
- **5G Support:** Whether the smartphone supports 5G or not.
- **Battery (mAh):** Battery capacity of the smartphone in mAh.

## Data Preprocessing

The dataset underwent several preprocessing steps, including:

- Data cleaning
- Handling missing values
- Feature engineering
- Normalization/standardization

## Data Visualization

We utilized various data visualization techniques to gain insights from the dataset. Some key visualizations include:

- Scatter plots
- Pie charts
- Pair plots
- Strip plots
- Swarm plots
- Bar graphs
- Histograms
- Interactive plots using Plotly Express


## Machine Learning Models

We applied several machine learning models to the dataset to predict and analyze smartphone attributes, including:

- Support Vector Machine (SVM) for Classification
- Support Vector Machine (SVM) for Regression
- K Fold
- Grid Search
