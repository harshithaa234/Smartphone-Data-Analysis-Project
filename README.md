# Smartphone-Data-Analysis-Project

## Project Overview

This project involves data visualization and machine learning model applications on a dataset webscraped from the Flipkart website. The dataset originally had only a few columns, but  preprocessed it to add more relevant columns according to our needs.

## Contents

- **processed_final.csv:** Contains the cleaned and preprocessed data.
- **Casestudy-2.ipynb:** Includes the code for data analysis, visualization, and machine learning models.
- **Untitled.ipynb:** Provides detailed insights and findings from the analysis.


## Dataset Description

The dataset includes various attributes of smartphones listed on Flipkart. Initially, the dataset had limited columns, but additional columns were added during preprocessing to enhance the analysis.

## Data Preprocessing

The dataset underwent several preprocessing steps, including:

- Data cleaning
- Handling missing values
- Feature engineering
- Normalization/standardization

## Data Visualization

We utilized various data visualization techniques to gain insights from the dataset. Some key visualizations include:

Scatter plots
Pie charts
Pair plots
Strip plots
Swarm plots
Bar graphs
Histograms
Interactive plots using Plotly Express

## Machine Learning Models

We applied several machine learning models to the dataset to predict and analyze smartphone attributes, including:

Support Vector Machine(SVM) for Classification
Support Vector Machine(SVM) for Regression
K Fold
Grid Search
